# filesort

Filesort saves you time cleaning your desktop by organizing files by their format types and moving them into a location of your choice. 

Fill in the preset values 'loc1' and 'loc2' for the source and destination in 'sort.py'. Filesort will do the rest.

This program interlaps Python3 with Linux system calls to accomplish the sorting task. If directories for a file format are already found in the destination directory, they will be sorted into files, but will not be transferred from the source. If directories are already found in the source but not the destination, the files will still be sorted and transferred.
